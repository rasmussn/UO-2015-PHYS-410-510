Assignment for the week.

1. Write a program to numerically integrate the function f(x) = x*x over
   the interval [0,1] for each of the following methods:

      a. Random sampling
      b. Midpoint rule
      c. Trapezoidal rule
      d. Simpson's rule

2. Plot the error for each method as a function of N, where N is the
   number of random samples or the number intervals.
